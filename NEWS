Changes since 1.0.2

* Changed license from Hewlett-Packard proprietary to GPL.  Kudos to 
  Hewlett-Packard for agreeing to open source this project.

* Don't need to do an initial seek (with the --offset option), since offsets
  are contained in each transfer.  This fixes a bug when writing to
  tape drives where seeks are illegal.

Changes since 1.0.1

* Added an FAQ.

* Alphabetically sorted options and parameters in usage and man-pages.

* Added a PATTERNS section to the man-page.  This section will describe the 
  the various algorithms used for the --pattern option.

* Can now use the tebibytes(t) and terabytes(T) units for
  the --min-block-size, --max-block-size, --offset options and the the
  FILE_SIZE parameter.

* I/O error messages are sent to the log file as well as the screen.

* Read and write under-run are no longer treated as errors.  Under-runs
  are now logged instead.


Changes since 1.0.0

* Fixed a segmentation fault when using random block sizes with the --progress
  option.

* Fixed a memory leak that occurs when --iterations is 0 or greater
  than 1.

* Updated the documentation.

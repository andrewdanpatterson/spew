SPEW

The spew package is used to test I/O performance and to generate load
on character devices, block devices, and file systems.  It is similar
to the lmdd program found in the lmbench test-suite
(http://www.bitmover.com/lmbench). It is a bit easier to use than lmdd
and has some added functionality.  For example, it can test both
random and sequential I/O.

The spew project is maintained in GitHub.  It can be found at:

   https://github.com/apatters/spew

Spew creates an output and/or input stream and writes and/or reads to
and/or from a file or device. It can be used on both random-access
(disk drives) and sequential-access (tape drives) devices. Various
patterns can be used to test data integrity.

The spew program has three modes, --write, --read, and
--read-after-write. The --write mode just writes data to the file or
device. The --read mode reads data from a file. The --read-after-write
mode (or --raw) will write the data then read it back in while doing
data verification.

The spew program can generate both cumulative and semi-instantaneous
transfer-rate statistics. Here is an example of spew being used to
test the sequential transfer rate to a file system:

   $ spew --pattern=random --min-buffer-size=64k 1g /tmp/bigfile
   Write transfer rate:    46677.47 KiB/s    Transfer time: 00:00:22

You can use the --progress option to display a "progress-meter" that
also shows intermediate transfer rates:

  $ spew --read-after-write --progress --pattern=numbers \
  --min-buffer-size=64k 1g /tmp/bigfile

                                Spew FAQ
                                =============

This is the Spew FAQ.  Any suggestions/corrections/etc should be
directed to andrew.patterson@hpe.com.  The FAQ answers the following questions:

    1) Who came up with the names "Spew"?
    2) How do I by-pass the buffer or disk cache to find the true
       performance of a device?

  1) Who came up with the name "Spew"?

     Larry Fenske was the author of the original 20-line C version of Spew.
     He also originated the name.

  2) How do I by-pass the buffer or disk cache to find the true performance
     of a device?

     You can use the -s|--synchronous option for writes.  This adds
     the O_SYNC option when the file is opened.  All writes will then
     block until flushed to disk (Note that your device itself may
     still cache).

     Reads are a little more complicated.  The O_SYNC option is
     ignored for reads.  On Linux, you can use spew's -d|--direct
     option which will bypass the buffer cache for both reads and
     writes.  It will also disable read-ahead for reads.  On other
     operating systems (like HP-UX) or old versions of Linux (kernels
     before 2.4.21 or so), you may have to use a special device
     file. On old versions of Linux, you would use raw device files
     (see raw(8)).  On HP-UX, you would use the the /dev/rdsk/* device
     files.  I have no idea what to use on Windows.
